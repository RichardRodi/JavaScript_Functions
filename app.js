console.log("EXERCISE 1 IsOdds:\n==========\n");
//## Exercise 1: Minimum Number

//- In the past, we created a selection statement inside a loop that counted from 1 to 100, and only printed out the odd numbers.
//- Your task is to write a function printOdds() that takes one parameter, count, and uses a loop and selection statement to count to the number passed in, printing out the odd numbers.

//1. Declare a function named `printOdds` using declaration notation (`function <name>(){...}`)
//2. The function should take in one parameter named `count`
//3. The function body should:
   //- contain a `for loop` that counts to the parameter passed in,
  // - an `if/else` statement that determines if the current value is odd,
  // - and then `console.log()` the odd value to the console
//4. BONUS: Now that you do not know exactly what number may be passed in as `count`, use an `if` statement to account for a negative `count` being passed in.

function isOdds(count)
{
    for (let i = 0; i <= count; i++ )
    {
        if (i % 2 != 0)
        console.log(`${i} is Odd:${i}`)
    }
        if (count < 0)
        console.log("Please put it in postive number!")
}

console.log("EXERCISE 2 Legal?:\n==========\n");


//## Exercise 2: Legal?

//- Write a function that receives a name and age, and prints a greeting message to the console using the name.

//1. Declare a function named `checkAge` using declaration notation (`function <name>(){...}`)
//2. The function should take in two-parameters named userName & age
//3. The function body should:
  // - declare and initialize an aboveSixteen local variable with string value: "Congrats ${userName}, you can drive!",
   //- declare and initialize an belowSixteen local variable with string value: "Sorry ${userName}, but you need to wait until you're 16.",
   //- an `if/else` statement that determines if the `age` value is below 16,
   //- and then `console.log()` the correct message to the console.
//4. BONUS: Remember that paramaters are optional, and no `name` or `age` value could be passed in. Correctly account for no parameter being passed in.

    let oldEnough = `Congrats ${userName}, You can drive!`;
    let notOldEnough = `Sorry ${userName}, You can't drive!`;

//Write a function that receives two parameters, x and y coordinates in
//the Cartesian plane, and prints out a message indicating if the point (x, y) lies on either the x or y axis,

 //For example:

 //- (0, 2) is on the x axis
 //- (1, 2) is in Quadrant 1

//the three sides make (equilateral: all side lengths equal, isosceles: only two side lengths equal, or scalene: all different side lengths).

//## Exercise 5: Data Plan Status

//Write a function that will display feedback on cell phone data usage. Cell phone
//plans for this particular company give you a certain amount of data every 30 days
//which must be used or they are lost (no rollover). We want to track the average amount of data
 //used per day and inform the user if they are using too much data or can
//afford to use more.

//Write a function that accepts the following parameters:

//- `planLimit`: amount of data in the plan per 30 day period
//- `day`: the current day in the 30 day period
//- `usage`: the total amount of data used so far

//The function should compute whether the user is over, under, or right on the average
//daily usage under the plan. It should also inform them of how much data is left
//and how much, on average, they can use per day for the rest of the month. If
//theyâ€™ve run out of data, it should inform them of that too.

//For example, if the user enters `planLimit = 100`, `day = 15`, and `usage = 56`, your program should print
//out something similar to the following.

//```txt
//15 days used, 15 days remaining
//Average daily use: 3.333 GB/day
//You are EXCEEDING your average daily use (3.73 GB/day),
//continuing this high usage, you'll exceed your data plan by
//11.9 GB.
//To stay below your data plan, use no more than 2.93 GB/day.
